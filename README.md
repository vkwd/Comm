# Comm
To help BANK Pensioners on superannuation, a lump sum amount to meet Marriage/Educational expenses etc.is paid.
Commutation is akin to a reverse LIC Policy-Assured sum is received upfront but the premium is paid for the Fixed Term of 15Yrs.
Maximum commutation is 1/3rd of Basic Pension. 
Basic Pension is 1/2 of Basic Pay admissible for basic Pension at the time of superannuation.
Thereafter, the Pensioner  will be entitled to 2/3 of the pension i.e. his Basic Pension is reduced by the value of amount commuted.
The reduced portion of the pension is  restored after a period of 15 years from the date of
commutation.  
The method of commutation is based on commutation factor(CF) determined on the age of the retiree Next Birth day.
The commutation factor is derived from the available tables. For example, commutation factor of 9.81(age next birth day 61) is applicable to a pensioner willing to commute his pension on superannuation(60 years).
Commutation is not available in case of family pension.

This calculator is an attempt to help bank retirees calculate the Commutation Value without refence to tables/basic pension/reduced basic pension after commutation.
